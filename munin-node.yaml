  Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs
  of virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while
  still maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.
  This package contains the grapher/gatherer. You will only need one
  instance of it in your network. It will periodically poll all the
  nodes in your network it's aware of for data, which it in turn will
  use to create graphs and HTML pages, suitable for viewing with your
  graphical web browser of choice.  It is also able to alert you if any
  value is outside of a preset boundary, useful if you want to be
  alerted if a filesystem is about to grow full, for instance.  You can
  do this by making Munin run an arbitrary command when you need to be
  alert it, or make use of the intrinsic Nagios support.  Munin is
  written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent
  RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can follow a

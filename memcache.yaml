  memcache service
description: 
  Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com,
  a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1
  million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers.
  memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page
  load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the
  databases on a memcache miss.

  memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
  to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
  are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
  of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
  apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
  this burden across several machines.

  MongoDB is a high-performance, open source, schema-free document-
  oriented  data store that's easy to deploy, manage and use. It's
  network accessible, written in C++ and offers the following features :
  * Collection oriented storage - easy storage of object-     style data
  * Full index support, including on inner objects   * Query profiling
  * Replication and fail-over support   * Efficient storage of binary
  data including large     objects (e.g. videos)   * Auto-sharding for
  cloud-level scalability (Q209) High performance, scalability, and
  reasonable depth of functionality are the goals for the project.  This
  is a metapackage that depends on all the mongodb parts.
